Here are the custom 'The Name Game' lyrics for Susan. 
Have fun!
```
Susan, Susan, bo-busan
Banana-fana fo-fusan 
Fee-fi-mo-musan 
Susan!
```

You may notice the two sets of rules have one big difference:

    Correct: "...without the _first consonant sound_... "
    Incorrect: "At the end of every line, the name gets repeated without the _first letter_"
  
And here is an example that shows the error:

Here are the custom 'The Name Game' lyrics for Stephen. 
Have fun!
```
Stephen, Stephen, bo-btephen
Banana-fana fo-ftephen 
Fee-fi-mo-mtephen 
Stephen!
```

Go ahead, try to pronounce **btephen**.

We are going to use the incorrect rules because it's easier to code. If you finish and you want to try to fix the error let me know and I'll get you started.

Put your name in the [generator](https://thenamegame-generator.com/) and see how it works.

## Coding Time

1. Find **TODO 1** and change the code to use your name. Remember to add it as a String.
2. Find **TODO 2** and start implementing the code according to the rules.
. You may want to copy the rules into your code and convert them to valid Java String commands.
